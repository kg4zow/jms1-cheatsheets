# jms1-cheatsheets

This repo contains a small collection of "cheatsheets" I use, for the [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat/) command, both for work and in my personal life.

You're welcome to look at them, copy them, use them however you like. However, everybody is different, so if you're going use [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat), you'll probably want to start your own list of personal cheatsheets.
